In this test case, we study the conformational rearrangements of 
a very simple molecule, C4H6, which can transform 
from its CYCLE state, first to   
the CIS configuration, and finally
to the most stable TRANS configuration.

In the directory ANALYSIS, a preliminary run is shown, where the behaviour 
of some possible CV is studied, in the initial equilibrium conditions.
The chosen CV are 3 C-C distances and one torsion angle. 
During this run, we look at the typical fluctuations of the variables,
in order to be albe to set up the parameters for the metadynamics.

In the directories called H0...., more preliminary runs are shown, 
where the metadynamics is performed without introducing the hills (the
height of the hills is set to zero). The runs are performed with 
different set of variables (3D: 3 C-C distances, DT: torsion angle 
and one C-C distance) and  the effects of different masses and force 
constants are considered. 
It is interesting to notice that when one uses the 3D distances, masses, 
force constants and scaling factors for the 3 CV are all the same, 
because they have very similar fluctuations in the initial state.
This is not the case, when a distance and a torsion angle are chosen. 
Therefore the parameters have to be modified accordingly.

In the H... directories, the results of complete metadynamics are presented, 
for the two sub-sets of CV and for different parameters.


For all the examples,  most of the standard output file  has been omitted,
and only the initial and final parts are reported.
To save space only some of the *_mtd files have been included.
