This directory contains some tests of the distributed memory parallelization features, especially important to scale out the computations on several hundreds of processors.
The test case taken in consideration is  32 water molecules in the liquid phase at 100 Ry and MT pseudopotentials; 2 sets of runs were performed :1 - simple wavefunction optimization 2- 50 steps of CP dynamics.
The runs were all made on 1 midplane of IBM BG/L (512 nodes - 1024 processors) 
with diverse setups:

1)  no taskgroups
2)  4 taskgroups
3)  4 taskgroups + keep wfn in real space
4)  4 taskgroups + keep wfn in real space + single precision in the alltoall
5)  4 taskgroups + keep wfn in real space + single precision in the alltoall + distributed linear algebbra
6)  8 taskgroups + + keep wfn in real space + single precision in the alltoall
